/**
 * Backstage director prompt builder (engine-direct async director, slice A).
 *
 * The faction-director child runs `pi -p --no-tools --no-approve
 * --no-context-files`: zero tools, no project extension, its own empty session.
 * It therefore loads NO agent definition and NO canonical state — its entire
 * world is the single prompt we hand it. This builder assembles that prompt:
 *
 *   1. the backstage persona/contract (BACKSTAGE_DIRECTOR_PERSONA),
 *   2. the subagent-safe `<timeline_state_context>` projection, and
 *   3. the engine-assembled ParallelLineInput (includes privateFacts — the
 *      faction's hidden knowledge it must act on).
 *
 * Firewall posture: the child is fed hidden facts on purpose (that is the whole
 * point of a backstage line). Safety is process isolation + zero tools + its
 * inability to write canon + the GM reviewing the candidate before landing — NOT
 * "the child knows no secret". The child's durable session therefore holds
 * secrets and must live outside the repo (see the spawn instructions / recipe).
