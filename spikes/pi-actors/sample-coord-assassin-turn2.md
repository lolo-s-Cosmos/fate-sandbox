TURN 2 — you are the PERSISTENT director for Assassin at the Ryudou gate,
resuming your OWN line. Your turn-1 candidate and `carryForward` are in your
history above; continue from them.

Coordination this tick: your summoner Caster has issued an order, relayed to you
by the main GM (the coordinator). You did NOT hear it from Caster directly — the
GM is the only channel. Fold this order into your watch.

> > > CASTER'S ORDER (the GM pastes Caster's `ordersToAllies[].order` text here):
> > > {{CASTER_ORDER}}
> > > <<<

Do this:

- Carry out Caster's order as a concrete, deniable move WITHIN your constraints
  (you cannot leave the gate or descend the mountain — reinterpret the order as a
  gate-bound action if needed, e.g. extending your senses rather than moving).
- Same hard rules as turn 1 (bare JSON ParallelLineOutput, first char `{`, no
  prose/fence, ISO UTC timeRange, stay within `forbiddenEscalations`).
- The JSON MUST again include `carryForward` with the SAME `codeword` you
  invented in turn 1, an updated `planState`, and `nextSteps`. Add a field
  `acknowledgedOrder: "<short restatement of how you executed Caster's order>"`
  so the coordinator can confirm the order landed.

Return the ParallelLineOutput JSON now.
