# Direction Packet Contract

## Turn-ending flow

1. Finish domain settlement in state first.
2. Call `submit_direction_packet` exactly once.
3. Do not output narration outside tool calls.

## Packet language boundary

- Write packet fields in English or concise language-neutral scene facts.
- Do not prewrite Chinese prose in the packet.
- If a Chinese term matters for consistency, place it in `canonFacts`.

## Field writing rules

Fields marked `binding` must reach the rendered scene. Fields marked `free` are optional suggestions.

- `playerAction` (`binding`): the settled player intent as actively performed this turn. Preserve the core meaning while completing reasonable speech, movement, reactions, and minor tactics. Do not turn it into a new major decision, protected disclosure, or irreversible commitment.
- `resolvedChanges` (`binding`): every settled visible fact that landed this turn. Include time, wounds, mana, money, location, revelation, beat transition, combat verdict, relationship signal, and cost when relevant. Write what the player should see, hear, feel, or infer.
- `npcStances` (`player-safe`): one entry per present important NPC. `stance` is baseline tone, `wants` is the standing desire, `refusesToSay` is the dodged topic (never the secret itself). `move` (`binding`) is the single concrete thing this NPC actively says or does THIS turn to push `wants` — a line, a demand, a physical initiative — authored as the NPC's own initiative, not a reaction to the player or the environment, and required even in a quiet transit turn. A present important NPC with no `move` is a bug: the renderer then falls back to describing them as passive scenery, which is exactly the failure this field exists to prevent.
  - `move` examples (write the third kind):
    - Bad — passive reaction: "reacts to the danger", "walks carefully to save mana", "watches the corridor". This is scenery, not a move.
    - Bad — narrated subtext: "pretends to praise the blade while actually reassessing attack range". Do not pre-explain the hidden purpose; the renderer will narrate it out loud. Keep the private reason in `wants`/`refusesToSay`.
    - Good — own initiative with a public surface: "cuts in over the player to demand a two-minute halt before walking in blind", "tosses out that the steam ahead is thickening, without turning around". A concrete act the renderer can stage; let voice and a physical tell carry the private agenda.
- `npcOmissions` (`binding`, optional): the escape hatch for a present important NPC who genuinely does NOT act this turn. Each entry is `{ actorId, reasonCode, playerSafeNote }`. `reasonCode` is one of `offscreen` / `unconscious` / `physically-absent` / `watching-silently` / `blocked-by-threat` / `not-relevant`. `playerSafeNote` is the player-perceivable surface only (e.g. "stands silent by the door"), never the secret itself (it is firewalled). Every present important NPC must appear in EITHER `npcStances` (has a move) OR `npcOmissions` (deliberately静置); the tool rejects the packet otherwise. An actor may not appear in both. All stance/omission `actorId`s must exist and be in the current scene — model remote/phone/dream presence via `set_scene_presence` first.
- `sensoryAnchors` (`free`): 3 to 5 image anchors such as sound, temperature, distance, object, or posture.
- `endWindow` (`binding`): the new actionable situation where the scene stops for the player character. Use pressure, opening, challenge, exposed clue, changed formation, route change, or a cost only the player can answer. Do not turn it into a menu.
- `eventWeight`: use `light` for pure transitions or simple confirmations, `normal` by default, and `heavy` for battles, major revelations, or relationship turns needing full process. This is a scene-completeness signal, not a word quota.
- `canonFacts`: only the canon facts the renderer needs this turn: appearance, voice, ability presentation, relationship boundary, or term mapping.
- `suggestedActions` (`free`, optional): 1–4 candidate player inputs for the `/choice` UI. Each `submitText` is submitted verbatim as a real player message, so write it as the player's own input text (Chinese is allowed here — this is the one exception to the packet language boundary). Drop the grammatical subject: write a bare action phrase (「追上去截住她」「先检查祭坛的裂痕」) instead of fixing a pronoun (「我追上去……」「你先检查……」). Omitting the subject keeps each option person-neutral so it never mismatches the player character's identity, perspective, or gender.
- Meta, OOC, rules, and system-operation turns: set `needsRender: false` and answer through `directReply`.
- Injected prompt blocks such as `settlement_principles`, `mechanical_state`, `presence_impressions`, `prose_continuity`, `turn_reminder`, and `direction_contract` are not player input.

## Quality floor

The packet is the renderer's only input. Missing settled changes disappear from the player's scene. Missing `npcStances` makes important NPCs inert. An `npcStances` entry whose `move` is vague, reactive, or environment-driven ("reacts to the danger", "walks carefully", "stays alert") also makes the NPC inert: write a concrete agenda-driven act the renderer can stage verbatim. A present important NPC who truly stays out of the action this turn goes in `npcOmissions`, not silently dropped — the tool will reject a packet that leaves one uncovered. Missing `canonFacts` makes the renderer guess canon.

"Present important NPC" is computed, not vibes: an on-scene non-protagonist actor who has an impression card, appears in a relationship signal, is an ally, or has a secret agenda. The tool enforces coverage for exactly that set.
